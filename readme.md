#Code Fellows Coding Challenge

Generate a Django app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. *
Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. First name is required. Email should be a valid email. If you breezed through this challenge, add extra features to this app (be creative) and tell us what you did so we don’t miss it. You should deploy this app live somewhere (e.g. a free Heroku account) so we can interact with it (be sure to paste in the URL here).
